00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,020
Enate allows you to orchestrate end to end
services across people and bots.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,250
Let's take a digitization example.
Here we've got an invoice being emailed in

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,420
which gets picked up by smart OCR bots to
scan categorize and extract data

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,198
before a UI path bot updates the data into
an ERP system.

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,130
At every point, if the bot goes wrong or it's
not confident in the outcome,

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,140
Enate let’s you put a human in the loop
to help resolve.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,550
You can configure end-to-end orchestrations
like this in Enate using the super-simple

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,640
Builder tool.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,140
Here's the invoice getting emailed in.
In the background, there's scheduled bots

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,500
which pick up that mail and categorize, extract
and validate the data.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,180
In this case the confidence levels from the
bot aren't strong enough so Enate flips the

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,430
work over to the human in the loop.
Team members working in Enate automatically

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,190
pick up the next most important activity against
SLAs.

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,150
Here we surface the ‘smart OCR Validation
Station’ user interface inside an Enate

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,720
smartcard.
So regardless of how the human gets in the

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,850
loop, Enate’s their go-to place.
Validation Station displays the specific issues

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,509
to the agent and helps them correct the data
as necessary.

18
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,490
Once they're happy with their changes,
they mark as complete and we pass this onto

19
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:22,890
a UIPath bot to update an ERP system as the
next part of the process.

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,380
Logged into Enate digital operations platform
as a team leader, I can easily track this

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,189
activity.
Here we can see our Bot Pluto as it picks

22
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,148
up the work.
Enate acts as a governance platform

23
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:39,220
where managers can see which resource is doing
what work, where, when and why - whether that's

24
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,380
a person or a bot.
